<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Andrea Garcia and I work as legal assistant for Amazon. I graduated with my B.A. in Women's Studies from CSULB in 2019. During my undergrad I had a huge desire to work with underserved populations and adovcate for my community. I held internships with numerous public interest law firms and even worked as an intern for then Sentor Kamala Harris (my biggest bragging point). As the years have gone by, my career has made a slight change. Although I still would love to serve my community wherever possible, I now have desire to continue working for a tech company but in a different capacity. In the future I'd like to work as a software developer for a FAANG company.</p>
    
<h1>During my spare time</h1>
<ol>
<li>Go on long walks to meet my step count (aiming for 20,000 steps a day).</li>
<li>Spend time with my pets (5 dogs, 3 cats and a beautiful hamster named Rufino).</li>
<li>Drive pointlessly along the coast.</li>
</ol>
    
<p> My favorite website is the <a href="https://www.madewell.com/womens/sale">madewell site</a>
(the sale section).</p>
