<h2>School</h2>
<p> 
<strong>Cerritos College</strong> <br>
I attended Cerritos College from Fall of 2014 until Spring of 2017. I received my Associates in Art in Gender Studies. I returned to Cerritos College Fall of 2022 to further enrich my education and in hopes to gain knowledge and expertise in the field of computer science. <br>
<strong>CSULB</strong> <br>
I graduated from the California State University, Long Beach in the Spring of 2019. I majored in Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies and anticipated using my studies to pursue a career in immigration advocacy.</p>
